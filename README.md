# FlightPricePrediction
This is a machine learning project based on the kaggle dataset for ticket price in india, I have done this project with my friends at the university for our python course.


conda activate base
pip install -U streamlit
pip install -U plotly
streamlit run app.py

you have to use these commands in your terminal in order for you to run the code, also you need to download anaconda :) because conda activate base won't work without it:(
